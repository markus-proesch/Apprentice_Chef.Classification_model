Build a Classification model predicting if a customer would accept a promotion offer, or not

In an effort to diversify their revenue stream, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has launched Halfway There,
a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California
vineyard every Wednesday (halfway through the work week). The executives at Apprentice Chef
also believe this endeavor will create a competitive advantage based on its unique product
offering of hard to find local wines.

Halfway There has been exclusively offered to all of the customers in the dataset you received,
and the executives would like to promote this service to a wider audience. They have tasked
you with analyzing their data, developing your top insights, and building a machine learning
model to predict which customers will subscribe to this service.
